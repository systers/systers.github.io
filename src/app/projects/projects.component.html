Our projects focus on impacting users and communities by improving their lives with technology. We use various development languages and technologies, while encouraging our contributors to learn new skills and solve new challenges. We host all of our code on GitHub, where contributors can publish and store their code, connect with other open source communities, and learn version control with Git. Github tracks your personal contributions, so you can share them as part of your portfolio.

# systers.github.io
## Project Overview
This is the main website for Systers Open Source.  It contains information about our various open source projects, the programs we participate in (as well as their historical data), information about how to contribute, and general information about how to contact us.

In the future, we hope to add Google Calendar integration and additional orientation/onboarding materials.

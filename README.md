# systers.github.io
## Project Overview
This is the main website for Systers Open Source.  It contains information about our various open source projects, the programs we participate in (as well as their historical data), information about how to contribute, and general information about how to contact us.

In the future, we hope to add Google Calendar integration and additional orientation/onboarding materials.

## Installation
To preview, run these commands in your terminal (as long as you’ve previously installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)):

1. git clone https://github.com/systers/systers.github.io
2. cd systers.github.io
3. npm install
4. npm install -g @angular/cli
5. npm i -g typescript
6. node server.js
7. ng serve -o

Then open http://localhost:4200 in your browser, you should see a current version of the website!

If in step 6, you use npm start, you can see the local version hosted at http://localhost:8050.

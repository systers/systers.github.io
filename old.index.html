<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Systers GitHub Open Source Page</h3>

<p>Our goal is to have projects that impact users and communities by improving their duties/tasks with technology.
We want to provide projects in 1)various development languages, 2) technologies, and 3) challenges.
Systers will still maintain our current wiki for resources, however, we have created a repository here on github
(by popular demand) so that students/mentees can publish and store their code, connect with other open source
communities who use github, and learn how to store revisions of code like Git (<a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1" target="_blank">Try Git</a>!).

More Github training materials >> <a href="https://training.github.com/resources/videos/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Some of the projects below are for <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/" target="_blank">Peace Corps</a> volunteers (PCVs) and administrators. It is important that PCVs
have tools that can help collect data and report back to PC headquarters on progress and status of their assignments.
It's just as important for PC administrators/managers to track their PCVs activities and assignments. Additionally,
our organization, <a href="http://anitaborg.org/" target="_blank">Anita Borg Institute</a> and Systers community have open source projects that will help our staff manage
our volunteers and help our members collaborate better.
</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h4>Peace Corps Projects</h4>

<p>The Peace Corps has many volunteers (PCVs) out in the field assigned in various countries around the world.
They get a lot of great technology projects started, usually at hackathons, but they never get any of them complete
so that they can deploy the applications to the PCVs who really need technology to help their assignments in many ways.
Systers will be working on 4 main Peace Corp projects that we hope to have deployed by the end of this program.</p>

<p>[1] PeaceTrack - (<a href="https://github.com/systers/peacetrack-android/wiki">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/systers/peacetrack-ios/wiki">iOS</a> versions)

<h4>Systers Projects</h4>
<p>Systers, an Anita Borg Institute (ABI) Community, has very specific needs to help them internally and externally with managing volunteers and having a Systers (and sub groups) portal. The Volunteer Management System and Systers Portal will hope to help Systers and volunteers to make an engaged connection.

Systers will also also be upgrading to the latest Systers GNU Mailman and applying our customized Systers features
to the latest release. Because we have a customized version, it is a very complex and has a higher difficulty level for
programmers.

Additionally, we have a new project this year to help manage our community's meetups.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>-->
